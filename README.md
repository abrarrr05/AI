## **HEAT ANOMALY DETECTOR FOR SOLAR PANEL (HADSOL)**

As time goes by, we cannot continue to rely on fossil energy sources. So there needs to be a breakthrough to use alternative energy sources, one of which is the sun via solar panels. As with other electronic goods, solar panels are also not immune from anomalies caused by several things, including being dirty or having an anomaly in one of the components. Anomalies resulting from solar panels usually occur with a hotspot at 1 point or even several points. Of course this will have an impact on the lack of electricity produced, this can cause financial losses for individuals or industrial companies that use solar panels. Because of the above, it is necessary to carry out massive control to avoid the occurrence of this hotspot anomaly. To control the health of solar panels, we cannot monitor them every second. So the need for Artificial Intelligence assistance is to continuously monitor the health of the solar panels. Therefore, we are trying to make a breakthrough in creating a project entitled "Heat Anomaly Detector for Solar Panels (HADSOL)". This will make it easier for users to massively monitor the health of solar panels with the help of Artificial Intelligence. So as to minimize or even eliminate the losses experienced because of this, we can be helped to monitor easily and efficiently.
